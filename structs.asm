; !!! WARNING ABOUT READABILITY OF THIS CODE !!!
;
; RGBDS, being the venerable/old/decrepit (pick on depending on mood) assembler that it is, requires
; all label, variable etc. definitions to be on column 0. As in, no whitespace allowed (otherwise, syntax error)
; Meanwhile, these macros tend to use a lot of nesting (requiring indenting for readability),
; as well as variable definitions (requiring none to work).
; As you can probably tell, those two conflict and result in very poor readability
; Sadly, there is nothing I can do against that short of using a special preprocessor,
; which I refuse to do for usability's sake.
; You have all my apologies, how little they may matter, if you are trying to read this code
; I still did my best to use explicit comments and variable names, hope they will help!
